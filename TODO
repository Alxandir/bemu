* Clean up translation so we don't inspect every instruction twice
  (once in bt_can_translate, once in the actual translation or
  simulation)
* Translate callouts as calls into the interpreter, rather the
  kludigly special-casing them in bt_translate_and_run
* Register allocation within frags
* Better assembly generation (do ops in-place when possible)
